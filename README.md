# SAS-Employee-Attrition-and-Performance-project

This is a project we did in the class with our professor as part of the People Analytics Certificate, as an introduction to SAS.

Goal:
What company drivers impact attrition for each employee, e.g. 
Does low job satisfaction or something else leads to attrition, across departments?
Are there like-employee cohorts that, as a group, are at a higher risk for attrition and could be addressed holistically versus individually?
What are the common themes across the employee base that could be used to form a program or campaign for employees that would resonate?
